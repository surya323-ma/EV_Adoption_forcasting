EV-Vehicle-Charging-Demand-Prediction
Project Overview
The Electric Vehicle Adoption Forecasting project aims to predict the future adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) using historical registration data from the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). This forecasting model assists urban planners in anticipating infrastructure needs, particularly for charging stations, thereby supporting sustainability goals and enhancing user satisfaction.

Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project contains monthly records of registered vehicles in Washington State, categorized by vehicle type. Key features of the dataset include:

Date: The date of vehicle registration (YYYY-MM-DD format).
County: The geographic region of the vehicle owner's residence.
Vehicle Primary Use: The primary intended use of the vehicle (e.g., Passenger, Truck).
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): Count of vehicles powered solely by an onboard electric battery.
Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): Count of vehicles powered partially by an onboard electric battery.
Electric Vehicle (EV) Total: The sum of BEVs and PHEVs.
Non-Electric Vehicle Total: Count of vehicles that are not electric.
Total Vehicles: All registered vehicles in the county.
Percent Electric Vehicles: The percentage of electric vehicles compared to non-electric vehicles.
